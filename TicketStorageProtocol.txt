TicketStorage protocol
	- Each Ticket gets its own folder by ID name
	- Each Telecom Room per ticket gets its own folder - Unless it has only one TR
	- Configuration files are stored for before and after modification, covering my ass
	- Configuration files are stored in their TR folder, or in the root folder for only one TR
	- Only stores TICKETS, not other scheduled jobs
	- Uses a Directory.json to keep track of Tickets in the system
